For various reasons, this blog is going to be focussed just on C++ programming, as boring as that may sound.

I'll try not to make it _too_ boring, but we'll see.

Meanwhile everything _else_ will still exist, just not here. Starting with the last two posts.

If you want to try to find me you still can; but I'm just not going to advertise it, that's all.

**Edit**: Ok, It doesn't _entirely_ have to be limited to that, I can still share some additional stuff, perhaps just not the _interesting_ stuff.
