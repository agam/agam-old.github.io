<p>I came across a reference to Marvin Minsky&rsquo;s 1970 Turing Award Lecture. I&rsquo;ve barely read any of these lectures, always assuming they would be empty or pedantic or plain boring. Reading this changed that perception completely.</p>

<h2 id="science-and-education">Science and Education</h2>

<p>The structure of this lecture seems very interesting to me; it seems to be divided into two parts. The first focussing more on computer science and its failings, and the second on (what seems to me) education.</p>

<p>This post is about the first part. And by &ldquo;about&rdquo; I mean just extracts with minimal commentary.</p>

<h2 id="the-trouble-with-computer-science">The trouble with Computer Science &hellip;</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>The trouble with computer science today is an obsessive concern with form instead of content.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(yes, that&rsquo;s the opening line!)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This essay has three parts, suggesting form-content confusion in <em>theory of computation</em>, in <em>programming languages</em>, and in <em>education</em>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(yes, I said two parts earlier &hellip; I just clubbed the first two together)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Suppose that we had <em>n</em> computers instead of just one. How much can we speed up what kinds of calculations? For some, we can surely gain a factor of <em>n</em>. But these are rare. For others, we can gain log <em>n</em>, but it is hard to find any or to prove what are their properties. And for most, I think, we can gain hardly anything; this is the case in which there are many highly branched conditionals, so that look-ahead on possible branches will usually be wasted. <strong>We know almost nothing about this; most people think, with surely incorrect optimism, that parallelism is usually a profitable way to speed up most computations.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>(&ldquo;surely incorrect optimism&rdquo;! I agree!)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&hellip; in today&rsquo;s computer science curricula &hellip; almost all their time is devoted to formal classifications of syntactic language types, defeatist unsolvability theories, <strong>folklore about systems programming</strong>, and generally trivial fragments of &ldquo;optimization of logic design&rdquo; &ndash; the latter often in situations where the art of heuristic programming has far outstretched the special-case &ldquo;theories&rdquo; so grimly taught and tested &ndash; and <strong>invocations about programming style almost sure to be outmoded before the student graduates</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(yup, quite true even today)</p>

<h2 id="the-trouble-with-programming-languages">The trouble with programming languages &hellip;</h2>

<blockquote>
<p><em>SYNTAX IS OFTEN UNNECESSARY</em>. <strong>One can survive with much less syntax than is generally realized</strong>. Much of programming syntax is concerned with suppression of parentheses or with emphasis of scope markers. There are alternatives that have been much underused.
&hellip; such devices as infixes and operator precedence &hellip; have their place. But <em>their importance to computer science as a whole has been so exaggerated that it is beginning to corrupt the youth</em>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(I wonder what he would have thought of <em>C++</em> !)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The clumsiness, for humans, of writing all the parentheses is evident; <strong>the advantages of not having to learn all the conventions &hellip; is often overlooked</strong>.
It remains to be seen whether a syntax with explicit delimiters is reactionary, or whether it is the wave of the future.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(a possible nod to Lisp ?)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Much can be done to clarify the structure of expressions in such a &ldquo;syntax-weak&rdquo; language by using indentation and other layout devices that are outside the language proper.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(a possible precursory nod to Python ?)</p>

<h2 id="moving-forward">Moving forward &hellip;</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>What is a compiler for? The usual answers resemble &ldquo;to translate from one language to another&rdquo; or &ldquo;to take a description of an algorithm and assemble it into a program, filling in many small details.&rdquo; For the future, a more ambitious view is required. Most compilers will be systems that &ldquo;produce an algorithm, given a description of its effect.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(not sure what to make of this)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>No matter how a language is described, a computer must use a procedure to interpret it. One should remember that <em>in describing a language the main goal is to explain how to write programs in int and what such programs mean</em>. The main goal <em>isn&rsquo;t</em> to describe the syntax.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(Sure, ok)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Paradoxically, though modern programming ideas were developed because processes were hard to depict with classical mathematical notations, designers are turning back to an earlier form &ndash; the equation &ndash; in just the kind of situation that <em>needs</em> program.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(aha! wait, what?)</p>

<h2 id="stay-tuned">Stay tuned</h2>

<p>So much for Part 1. I&rsquo;ll pick up the rest of the extracts next time.</p>
